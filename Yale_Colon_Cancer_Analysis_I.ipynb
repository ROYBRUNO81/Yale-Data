        "\n",
        "This notebook is the first part of our Yale colon cancer analysis log. We\n",
        "take the raw data from the microscope and turn it into organized datasets,\n",
        "maps of the cells, and figures that show where different cell types are and\n",
        "which genes they use. Everything we create is saved in the **YALE Data**\n",
        "folder; the original files stay in **Raw Data**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What we do, step by step:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Loading and organizing the raw data.** We start by loading the five raw\n",
        "   files: the gene readings per cell, where each image region is, cell\n",
        "   measurements, the transcript list, and the cell outlines. We then match\n",
        "   each row of numbers to the right cell and put everything into one\n",
        "   dataset. That dataset is saved so the rest of the notebook can use it.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **First look at the tissue.** We make one picture per image region (361\n",
        "   in total). Each picture has two panels: on the left we show where the\n",
        "   cells sit and color them by the vendor’s cell-type label; on the right we\n",
        "   draw the same cells as outlines with the same colors. This gives a quick\n",
        "   view of how cell types are arranged in the tissue.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Cleaning the data and finding cell groups.** We remove low-quality\n",
        "   cells, scale the gene readings so we can compare cells fairly, and then\n",
        "   find groups of similar cells. We build a 2D “map” of the cells and\n",
        "   assign each cell to a cluster. We save simple plots that show data\n",
        "   quality, the map colored by cluster, and which genes stand out in each\n",
        "   cluster.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Summarizing the top genes per cluster.** For each cluster we list the\n",
        "   top 20 genes that best define it. We save a table (yes/no per gene per\n",
        "   cluster) and one small dot plot per cluster so we can see at a glance\n",
        "   which genes are “on” in which group.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Maps colored by each top gene.** We draw one map per gene for the top\n",
        "   10 marker genes in each cluster. Each map is colored by how much that\n",
        "   gene is turned on in each cell, so we see where that gene is active.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Map colored by the vendor’s cell types.** We make one map where cells\n",
        "   are colored by the vendor’s cell-type labels (not our clusters). That\n",
        "   lets us compare our clusters with those labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Where each cluster sits in the tissue.** We make the same kind of\n",
        "   pictures as in step 2 (one per image region), but we color cells by our\n",
        "   clusters. So we see where each cluster is located in real tissue.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Maps for known cell-type genes.** We take a hand-picked list of genes\n",
        "   that mark known cell types (epithelial, immune, stroma, etc.) and, for\n",
        "   each gene in our data, we draw a map colored by that gene. So we see\n",
        "   where those classic markers are expressed.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Same genes with a cluster breakdown.** For those same marker genes we\n",
        "   make a combined figure: the map on the left and, on the right, a bar\n",
        "   chart showing what share of the cells that “have” that gene fall in each\n",
        "   of our clusters, with bar color showing how strong the signal is. That\n",
        "   helps us link our clusters to known cell types.\n",

        "UMAP is a way to take many measurements per cell (thousands of genes) and represent them in a simple 2D picture. Cells that are similar in their gene activity end up close together on the plot; cells that are different end up far apart. So a UMAP is like a *map* of cells based on how alike they are. In the code we use **`sc.tl.umap`** to build this map. When we say \"expression UMAP,\" we mean a UMAP built from gene expression (how much each gene is turned on in each cell).\n",

In the code we use **`sc.tl.leiden`**. A **subcluster** is a finer grouping *within* a bigger group (e.g. different types of fibroblasts within all fibroblast-like cells). We get subclusters by running clustering again on just that subset of cells.\n",
